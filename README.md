Much of the information about these celestial objects is publicly accessible through datasets published by major observatories and space agencies. This particular dataset is a simplified version derived from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, available at [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS). The archive is managed by the California Institute of Technology as part of NASA’s Exoplanet Exploration Program and is freely available for research and educational use.

The dataset, named nasa_exoplanet_archive.csv, contains details such as the names of exoplanets and their host stars, discovery year and method, orbital radius and eccentricity, planetary mass and equilibrium temperature, as well as the host star’s surface temperature and gravity. It also includes the system's distance in parsecs (1 parsec ≈ 3.26 light years), sky coordinates (RA and Dec), and the apparent brightness (magnitude) of the object.
